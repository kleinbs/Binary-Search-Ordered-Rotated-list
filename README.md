Binary-Search-Ordered-Rotated-list
==================================

This was just a small test project. I haven't done this since my early days at college so I wanted to see if I could remember how to do it. Also learned a "kewl" trick along the way. It's prety easy to break this (hint, try inserting duplicate values), I'll have to get around to solving that problem in the future.
